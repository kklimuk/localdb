# LocalDB
A way to create named, persistent collections using the browser's localStorage key-value store (with subscriptions to their modifications!). I personally use this in mobile web or Apache Cordova (PhoneGap) apps to persist information.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and include localdb.js in your project's libraries.

## Coming Soon
* Metadata about which entry is currently active. Useful for items like users one of which is active at a time.

## Documentation
Coming soon...

## Contributing
Ask me to become a core contributor to the project or send in your pull requests.

## Release History
* 2013 May 24 - v0.1.0 - Implements adding, removing, and getting entries into the named collections. Also adds pub/sub functionality to the mix.
